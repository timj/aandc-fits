The Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) standard has been a great
boon to astronomy, allowing observatories, scientists and the public
to exchange astronomical information easily. The FITS standard,
however, is showing its age. Developed in the late 1970s, the FITS
authors made a number of implementation choices that, while common at
the time, are now seen to limit its utility with modern data. The
authors of the FITS standard could not anticipate the challenges which
we are facing today in astronomical computing. Difficulties we now
face include, but are not limited to, having to address the need to
handle an expanded range of specialized data product types (data
models), being more conducive to the networked exchange and storage of
data, handling very large datasets, and the need to capture
significantly more complex metadata and data relationships.


There are members of the community today who find some (or all) of
these limitations unworkable, and have decided to move ahead with
storing data in other formats. This reaction should be taken as a
wakeup call to the astronomy community to make changes in the FITS
standard or to see its usage fall. In this paper we detail some
selected important problems which exist within the FITS standard
today. It is not our intention here to prescribe specific remedies to
these issues; rather, we hope to call attention of the FITS and
greater astronomical computing communities to these issues in the
hopes that it will spur action to address them.

\section{Introduction}


The Flexible Image Transport System standard (FITS, Wells
et. al. 1981; and more recently, the definition of the version 3.0
FITS standard by Pence et. al. 2010) has been a fundamental part of
astronomical computing for a significant part of the past four
decades. The FITS format became the central means to store and
exchange astronomical data, and because of hard work by the FITS
community it has become a relatively easy exercise for application
writers, archivists, and end user scientists to interchange data and
work productively on many computational astronomy problems. The
success of FITS is such that it has even spread to other domains such
as medical imaging and digitizing manuscripts in the Vatican Library
(Rasband 2010; Allegrezza 2012).


Although there have been some significant changes, the FITS standard
has evolved very slowly since its genesis in the late 1970s. New types
of metadata conventions such as World Coordinate System (WCS,
Greisen \& Calabretta 2002, Calabretta \& Greisen 2002, Greisen et al
2006) representation and data serializations such as variable length
binary tables (Cotton, Tody \& Pence 1995) have been
added. Nevertheless, these changes have not been sufficient to match
the greater evolution in astronomical research over the same period of
time.


Astronomical research now goes beyond the paradigm of a set of
observational data being analyzed only by the scientific team who
proposed or collected it. The community routinely combines original
observations, theoretical calculations, observations from others, and
data from archives on the internet in order to obtain better and wider
ranging scientific results. Many research projects now involve many
diverse data sets from a range of sources. Instruments in astronomy
now produce many orders of magnitude larger datasets than were common
at the time FITS was born, in some cases requiring parallelized,
distributed storage systems to provide adequate data rates (Alexov et
al. 2012) .


Astronomers have increasingly come to rely on others to write software
to help process and analyze their data. Common libraries, analysis
environments, pipeline processed data, applications and services
provided by third parties form a crucial foundation for many
astronomers toolboxes. All of this requires that the interchange of
data between different tools needs to be as automated as possible, and
that complex data models and metadata used in processing are
maintained and understood through the interchange.


These changes in research practices pose new challenges for the 21st
century. We must address the need to handle an expanded range of
specialized data product types and models, be more conducive to the
distributed exchange and storage of data, handle very large datasets
and provide a means to capture significantly more complex metadata and
data relationships.


Already some of these limitations have caused members of the community
to seek more capable storage formats, both in the past (Starlink HDS,
Disney \& Wallace 1982; XDF, Shaya et al. 2000 and FITSML, Thomas et
al. 2000 and Thomas, Shaya and Chueng 2001), and in the present and
future (Anderson et al. 2011). There is a danger that the use of FITS
will fall should it not adapt to these new challenges.


It is our intended goal in this paper to highlight some selected,
important, problems which exist in the FITS core standard today. It is
not our intention to prescribe specific remedies to these issues;
rather, we hope to call the attention of the FITS and greater
astronomical computing communities to these issues in the hopes that
it will spur action to resolve them.


\section{Deficiencies of FITS for Modern Astronomical Research}


As technologies and research techniques in astronomy have evolved FITS
has not kept pace. As a result, gaps between FITS utility and the
needs of research have opened up and widened over time. In this part
of the paper, we detail many issues, or deficiencies of FITS, which we
see in this regard.


The deficiencies of FITS appear to fall into one of several
groups. These may be summarized as poor support for information
interchange, missing critical data models, inflexibility in
representing both metadata and data and poor support for large and/or
distributed data. We address each of these in turn below.

\subsection{Poor support for information interchange}

FITS originated as a delivery format for observatory data. It was the
format of choice when transporting data between different data
reduction environments such as IRAF, Starlink, AIPS and MIDAS.


However, requirements for interchange have evolved. Effective
interchange, as we shall illustrate, now includes things like the
ability to declare of models for use in higher level processing,
validation of models within the file and, at the most basic level, the
ability to declare which version of the FITS serialization is being
used.


It’s not as if we have not needed these things until now. In fact,
parts of the astronomical community have designed data formats to
satisfy some of these requirements. The ADC’s XDF, LOFAR’s HDF5 data
model (Alexov et al 2012), and Starlink’s NDF (Currie 1988;
Warren-Smith \& Wallace 1993 and see ADASS Poster P91) all serve as
examples in this regard. XDF was created primarily to support the
development of FITSML an XML version of the FITS data model which
could utilize XML schema for validation. NDF was developed in the late
1980s as a means of organizing the hierarchical structures that were
available via the Starlink HDS format when it became apparent that
arbitrary hierarchies could lead to chaos and lack of ability for
applications to interoperate.

\subsubsection{Lack of serialization/format versioning}


The designers and maintainers of FITS have espoused that a file is
``once FITS, forever FITS''\footnote{The rule dates back to the earliest
FITS standard document that was produced by by the NOST at Goddard in
1993. This rule, in turn, probably had its origin in the paper by
Grosbol et al. 1988, based on the statement:

``The most important rule for designing new extensions to FITS is that
existing FITS tapes must remain valid.  We are not permitted to alter
the basic format in such a way as to make existing FITS tapes invalid
or unreadable by standard FITS tape reading programs''

(Pence, W, private communication)}
Certainly some in the community see
this as a strength for the format as it appears to promote long term
stability and archivability of FITS data (Allegreza 2012, US Library
of Congress\footnote{see http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000317.shtml}).
The assumption that the format will be static has
consequences for its further development and use.


First, and most clearly, omitting the ability to version the file
means that currently no FITS reader knows what version of the format
it is reading. The usual assumption is that the latest version (v3.0)
is being read, however, there are still many data which predate this
version of FITS serialization making this supposition often incorrect.


The lack of versioning also limits the ability of our community to
move forward constructively with developing new FITS versions. Because
we must maintain slavish conformance to older format conventions, it
means that we accrete over time more and more “design rules” (or
limitations, if you will) which limit our ability to implement new and
needed features. Consider the awkward way, for example, in which the
HIERARCH convention was implemented (Wicenec, Grosbol \& Pence
2009). In order to provide the needed functionality, the designers
were forced into utilizing COMMENT keywords for non-comment
functionality. This behavior by the community will only increase,
fragmenting the FITS format through inaction rather than coordinated
design.


Both of these issues needlessly drive greater and greater complexity
in implementation of FITS parsers. Furthermore, lack of versioning
arguably works counter to the purpose of increased archivability of
the files. Counter to the maxim “once FITS, forever FITS”, FITS reader
software are not able to read just any version of FITS. Certainly,
were someone to utilize code developed in the early 1980s to read a
FITS file containing a binary table, or a FITS file with extensions,
it would fail because it would have no idea how to handle these data
structures. Suitability for archiving not only means that software are
backward compatible, but that older software can gracefully handle
newer versions of the format.


Versioning should be made part of the FITS standard in order to
address these problems. We cannot simply solve the lack of versioning
by adding a convention; conventions are not required to be implemented
and this is fundamental metadata about the serialization of FITS
itself. Furthermore, without the enforcement of being part of the
standard, versioning is unlikely to be implemented where it is needed
most, in the generation of new FITS files. Since any group can define
and use their own conventions to store real, meaningful data, it is
almost certain that since these conventions are not defined as part of
the file format (or even in a central location), at some time in the
future these definitions, along with the usefulness of the data, will
be lost.


\subsubsection{Inadequate declaration and validation of content meaning}


Related to, but separate from the lack of versioning of the
serialization, is the lack of ability to declare the presence of data
models and their associated semantic meaning.  By ‘data model’ we
adopt the first meaning available in the Wikipedia which is:


“a description of the objects represented by a computer system
together with their properties and relationships; these are typically
‘real world’ objects such as products, suppliers, customers, and
orders.”


Of course, objects in astronomy are more likely to involve things like
observations, instruments, and actual astronomical objects such as
stars. Likely properties one will encounter in a FITS file include
things like observational parameters (start/end times), astronomical
coordinates, name and properties of the observing instrumentation, and
so forth. In FITS-speak, we can say that any FITS keyword outside
those defined in the FITS standard is a data model parameter, and
collections of related FITS keywords form a data model. Ideally a data
model should be associated with a given, unique, namespace so that
collisions in naming of the models and requisite parameters are
avoided.


Important questions such as “are all of the data here?”, “is the
information in the file correct?” (no bad values for metadata/data),
“do the data conform to expected data model?”, and fundamentally “what
are these data you gave me about?” are all, generally speaking,
questions of “validation” which are related to the data model(s)
contained in any given file.


To illustrate better how FITS fails in this regard, consider that the
FITS community already has many shared, common data models. WCS and
some other FITS conventions such as OIFITS (Thureau et al. 2006),
MBFITS (Muders et al. 2006), and FITS-IDI (Griesen 2001) declare data
models. The declaration of keyword dictionaries\footnote{Some
collected data dictionaries with FITS keywords may be seen at the GSFC
FITS site, see http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits\_dictionary.html} is also
essentially an act of declaring a namespace and related data
model(s). So it is clear that we have need of these things, yet, the
only way in which we can currently determine that a file conforms to
one or more of these models is for a human to communicate this to one
another, for a human to inspect the file personally, or for special
purpose software, targeted to particular data models/namespaces, to be
written to detect the presence of the model(s) in the file.


Given the data volumes that we have in astronomy, the later choice is
clearly in the direction we should go, but is not practical in the
general case. The writing of generalized software to detect any data
models present in a given FITS file is currently a hopeless act as
there are constantly new data models being created and
modified. Keeping the code up to date will be problematic, at
best. Furthermore, there is the possible complication of more than one
data model being present. Without explicit signposts in the file, it
is likely hopeless to disambiguate which data models are present.


A means to capture the data model/namespace information, in the file,
should be found so that validation can be possible without human
inspection or specifically written software (similar, perhaps, in the
way that JSON or XML formats have schema). This approach has
additional benefits downstream. First, it will help to avoid
misinterpretation because it is better for the creator of the data
and/or data model to provide the machine readable information rather
than a downstream programmer. Second, there is a saving in effort
in that the model is done once and need not be repeated by numerous
downstream programmers.

\subsubsection{No support for alternative encodings}


The allowed character set for metadata and data in FITS is overly
restrictive and is limiting its application. The restrictions between
metadata and data do not differ significantly. For metadata, the
keywords which occur in the FITS header, FITS only supports the lower
7 bits of the US-ASCII encoding for keyword values and comments. For
data encoding, authors may again only use the lower 7 bits of ASCII
for text (string) capture in either ASCII or binary FITS tables
although the NULL character is allowed in certain cases in binary
tables.


The world of astronomy has evolved beyond capturing of scientific
information in 7-bit ASCII encoding. The FITS community has grown. Now
many data are captured by instruments designed, built and run by
non-English speaking investigators and astronomical research has grown
significantly elsewhere in the world. Whether as original
observational data products, reduced data, information from new
services or in capturing theoretical data, FITS is now required to
hold many data which are no longer originating in English-speaking
countries.


The current restrictive character set is really an
anachronism. Consider that the most common language on the planet,
Chinese, cannot be utilized easily in a FITS file. Forcing information
into English can easily result in loss of valuable meaning or force
the author to use some other format to store their data.


It is clear to us that support for alternative encodings is
needed. Simple issues which revolve around the value of keywords
like the expression of a person’s name (with accents, for example), or
the ability to utilize special scientific and mathematical symbols
(like the degree) should be handled. Tabular text values should
similarly be allowed alternative encodings for the same
reasons. Furthermore, while not as critical, the FITS community should
also consider the utility of allowing FITS keywords themselves to be
expressed in a broader range of characters.


\subsubsection{Informal variants}


Although not explicitly part of the official FITS standard, the
community has, in effect, accepted many variants from the standard as
being acceptable through their wide use. In practical terms this means
general FITS libraries must support these variants, significantly
complicating the software, and introducing inconsistencies between
libraries in which particular variants are not uniformly
supported. This is partly due to the lack of good validating tools
early on, but also due to a unwillingness to enforce the standard. As
an example, the newer VOTable format had a clearer specification, and
much better tools available for validation, yet a significant fraction
of existing VOTables being provided do not adhere strictly to the
standard. This issue will not be solved with a new format unless the
community takes the standard more seriously than it has in the
past.


Preventing this from happening with a new format will be aided significantly if:

\begin{itemize}
\item A strict validation tool is provided from the very beginning so that
those making files have an easy-to-use tool that indicates what
problems exist with the files they are creating.

\item Those that write libraries to support a new format take a hard line
against adding support for illegal variants.

\item Discouraging developers from making ad hoc tools to create files in
the new format rather than adopting use of a well-tested library (such
ad hoc tools are often the source of problem files)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Missing critical data models}


It is not the case that FITS is missing all needed data models. In
terms of structures which represent basic organizations of the
information used in astronomy FITS includes such things like “table”,
“image” or “data cube”. These items are really simple representations
of the data at a primitive level, and are certainly needed for basic
access to the information within the file.


Nevertheless, these structures, by themselves, do not contain much in
the way of necessary detail and semantic information which tells the
consumer exactly “what” it is they are actually consuming. While these
structures do provide for the capture of semantic information (such as
in the form of table column keywords) an additional data model (or
more) must still be created or implemented by the author of the FITS
file if there is a desire to convey “what” it is. Consider the many
types of images or tables which are possible. Semantic information, in
the form of a data model, allows the author to properly label the
information so that it can be scientifically consumed without human
interpretation. Such information includes the WCS, for example.


Our concern here is that there are either data models which are
insufficient or missing in FITS and which are very basic to scientific
(and in particular, astronomical) research. Other astronomical groups
have recognized the need for some of these models. We detail
several important missing data models in this section below.

\subsubsection{Scientific Errors}


The measurement of physical properties is fundamental to astronomy
research. It is thus ironic that FITS, which is purposely designed for
supporting astronomical research, has no standard data model for
capturing information about scientific errors.


We could easily list a great number of possible error types which
might be useful but trying to encompass all of the needs of the
community at once is likely to create an unwieldy data model. We
suggest that the community needs to provide for the most common needs,
and target that subset as a first, shared model. Earlier efforts which
might inform and help this work include local data models at sites
such as NOAO and STSci, the error models implemented in other data
formats like NDF, and software efforts underway in scientific
programming communities such as AstroPy. Each of these have valuable
insight into the requirements.


Nevertheless, we can anticipate that the following general
characteristics might be part of the model:

\begin{itemize}
\item Allow for both metadata and data to have errors.

\item Allow for extensible classification of the error type. For example,
“Gaussian” errors are also a subclass of “statistical” errors.

\item Allow association of more than one error class/type per
measurement. For example, allow for both systematic and statistical
errors to be associated with each measurement.

\item Allow for additional properties to be associated with each error
class. For example, “statistical” errors may have assigned “sigma”
value.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Limited WCS}


The existing FITS WCS data models illustrate some of the limitations
associated with FITS. The “once FITS, always FITS” idea required that
the current WCS standards were developed as an extension of the older
AIPS standard, and so inherited many of the inherent limitations of
that system. Even so they took a long time to be agreed. They are
complex yet incomplete and inflexible. They are inadequate for many
modern telescopes, and restrict creative use of novel coordinate
transformations in subsequent data analysis. For instance, raw data
must handle more distortion issues than the FITS WCS standard
projections can handle. There are some provisions for handling more
arbitrary distortions, but they are either cumbersome or too
simple. Perhaps the biggest limitation is that different
transformations of coordinates cannot be combined in flexible
ways. One is effectively limited to choosing only one of the solutions
available.


This is unfortunate. Not only does it reduce the range of
transformations that can be described, but it also makes it harder to
analyse the total transformation into its component parts thus making
understanding and manipulation of the total transformation harder. The
alternative approach - a “toolkit”-style system that creates complex
transformations by stacking simpler atomic mappings - is usually the
most efficient representation as far as data storage is concerned.


As an example, HST data requires multiple distortion components. Some
are small but discontinuous. Other are linear but time varying. There
is no FITS WCS compatible solution that handles these needs
well. [Other examples welcome].


Another case with poor support is IFU data. Many of these data sets
have discontinuous WCS models. The only way to support these in FITS
now is to explicitly map each pixel to the world coordinates. Besides
being space inefficient, it is difficult to manipulate in any simple
way.


In addition to limiting the description of raw telescope data, FITS
WCS also restricts what can be done with such data during subsequent
analysis. There are many potentially interesting transformations that
would result in the final WCS being inexpressible using the
restrictive FITS model. For instance, transforming an image of an
elliptical galaxy into polar or elliptical coordinates. Another
example may be attaching an alternate coordinate system to an image to
represent the pixel coordinates of a second image covering the same
part of the sky. These may not be common requirements, but they
illustrate the wide range of transformation that should be possible
with a flexible WCS system.


The inflexibility in the FITS solution arises from multiple issues,
but lack of namespaces is a serious barrier to providing a more
flexible solution. If one has multiple model components each with
similar parameters, how does one distinguish between them? One may use
the letter suffix, but that is also used to distinguish between
alternate WCS models. The limitation on keyword sizes presents
limitations on how many coefficients can be supported. The lack of any
explicit grouping mechanism requires complex conventions on how to
relate whole sets of keywords. With more modern structures, such
contortions and limitations are not necessary.


The reality is that to solve these problems, many software systems
have chosen alternate solutions and save their WCS information in FITS
files in other ways (or in separate files). For example, the AST
library (Warren-Smith \& Berry 1998) is not subject to these
limitations, but is forced to use non-standard FITS representations
when representing data in its own native FITS encoding.


\subsubsection{History/Provenance}


IVOA provenance model as an example of usage?


The FITS standard encourages people to store processing history
information in the header using a pseudo-comment field named
HISTORY. This works from the perspective of making the information
available to an interested human (assuming that each step in the data
processing adds information to the end of the history section of the
header) but the free-form nature of the entries makes it essentially
impossible for a software system to understand what was done to the
data. This may be possible within the constraints of a single data
reduction environment but it is highly unlikely that the content of
the HISTORY block can be understood by any other software. History
needs to be treated as a first class citizen with a standardized way
of registering important information such as the date, the software
tool and any relevant arguments or switches. A library interface
should also be encouraged to make it easy for people to add history
entries.


A related issue is data provenance. For a given processed data product
it is, in general, impossible to determine which data files
contributed. A data consumer would like to be able to find out which
raw data files were included and any relevant intermediate
products. There is no metadata standard for specifying this
information in output files and ideally this should again be supported
by a programmatic interface to minimize the mental overhead in
tracking ancestor data.


\subsubsection{Data Quality}


One of the more pressing needs in our era of shared and distributed
data is the need to know which data are “good” or, put another way, of
sufficient quality. We are long past the era when the data volume was
so small that it is practical to download all of the possible data of
interest and examine it locally.


Some might insist that this is an easily solved problem. Simply
declare a keyword, like ``DQUALITY'', and allow it to take a boolean
value. That example is an exaggeration, to be sure, but it helps to
illustrate that simplicity in this regard, is simplistic. Data quality
cannot be judged on a single, or even a small set, of parameters. The
data which are adequate for one type of use, may be wholly inadequate
in another usage context. Consider that engineering data generally are
unsuitable for science and vice versa. Many science data may be
unsuitable for other types of science (for example, studies of sky
background vs pointed source science).


A data quality model then, should be an ensemble of common statistical
measures of the type of dataset which may be used to derive
higher-level judgements of the quality/suitability of the data for
some other declared purpose. There are many higher types of data
quality models which will need be created from the lower-level
measures (image data quality, pointed catalog data quality, etc) and
from these particular, targeted, statistical measures data quality may
be judged by the dataset consumer without directly examining the data
themselves.


\subsubsection{Units}


The FITS support for units is syntactically flexible (albeit with
a few specification ambiguities which would be resolved by an explicit
grammar), but the model does not accommodate the full range of
contemporary astronomical data.  This is evident from the significant
fraction of unit strings in current databases which do not conform to
the FITS prescriptions.  The solution is not simply to expand the list
of recommended units since, as well as being slow, this fails to
distinguish between, for example, different definitions of the second,
or to communicate places where the distinction does or does not
matter.

There is also a provenance issue to defining new units, since -- to
pick an example of a unit of 'jupiter core mass', two different
groups may prefer different values for the mass, and indeed may not
regard it as simply an abbreviation for a certain number of
kilogrammes, but as a scaling mass whose value is to be fixed by a
separate, subsequent, calibration.

The purely syntactical issues surrounding unit strings are to some
extent being addressed by the IVOA's 'VOUnits' work, but the higher
level questions -- of communicating and defining new units, of
indicating documentation, and of converting between them in a
scientifically meaningful manner -- are out of scope for that work and
should be considered by the FITS community.


\subsection{Inflexibility in organizing and representing metadata and data}


What may be construed to be “FITS data” has changed significantly
since the founding of FITS. The original FITS specification mandated
only the capture of astronomical images. Almost a decade later, FITS
extensions (Grosbol et al. 1988), allowing for gathering multiple
related data structures in one FITS file, and ASCII tables (Harten et
al. 1988) were introduced. Binary tables followed in the next decade
(Cotton, Tody \& Pence 1995). Changes have also occurred in metadata
capture. Over the intervening years the FITS community has added new
metadata conventions (for example, HIERARCH and GROUPING; Jennings et
al. 2007) which have allowed for greater flexibility in capturing
metadata.


This expansion is to be expected and is all to the good. Nevertheless,
as we shall illustrate below, the expanded abilities to capture
information are still insufficient relative to actual need.


\subsubsection{Constrained metadata representation}


The basic element of metadata capture in a FITS file is the FITS
“card” which comprises a keyword name, a keyword value and a
comment. All FITS cards must contain the keyword name and keyword
value pair while comments in cards are optional. Comments may
sometimes contain information about units of the metadata value.


Metadata may comprise a rich assortment of data structures and
single-valued metadata are only the beginning. There is need to
capture sets, lists, vectors and objects within metadata (to name only
the most basic of structures). Yet FITS cards, without additional
conventions, are only capable of capturing single, scalar
keyword-value pairings. The expression of non-scalar, multi-valued
keywords is difficult in FITS and data model designers often resort to
special conventions to achieve this. For example, in order to hold a
keyword with either a ‘set’ or ‘list’ value, a common, non-standard,
convention adopted is to create a set of keywords sharing the same
base name followed by a integer value which may (or may not) indicate
order of the values (such as “ICMB001”, “ICMB002”, and so on).


This limitation on the range of metadata value structures is not the
only problem, even the expression single scalar values are
constrained. Consider that FITS cards are limited to 80 chars and FITS
keyword names may be no longer than 8 chars. The result of these
constraints is that keyword values may be no longer than 68 chars. Of
course, if you utilize all of the space for keyword values, then the
comment, or keyword values longer than 68 characters will need another
convention in order to capture it (such as creating a continuation
line in the header using the CONTINUE convention\footnote{see http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/registry/continue/continue.pdf}).


Let us now consider the impact of keyword name constraints. Not only
are keyword names limited to a small set of characters but keyword
names are restricted to no more than 8 characters. Often these
restrictions prevent clear labelling of the metadata element because
authors are forced to map longer, more descriptive, names into the
truncated size. Non-English authors are additionally forced to map
into the limited character set. If you doubt this leads to problems,
try the following experiment: open any non-trivial FITS file and scan
the header. Unless you are an expert in the data models present in the
file (and sometimes even if you are!) its easy to find that the
cramped names of the keywords often leads to arcane and confusing
metadata.


These restrictions on the FITS card have other impacts as well. They
can and do limit the utility of FITS conventions which may be
implemented. Take, for example, the previously mentioned issue with
the HIERARCH convention and its use of COMMENT keywords for
non-comment purposes.


Finally, while being the least problematic of these issues, but still
important, is the problem of the 2880 character logical record. While
it is largely a low-level oddity of FITS now, it does have some small
practical impact. Consider that this formatting requirement negatively
impacts many FITS files today which have significant metadata. It
often results in odd sections of the FITS file containing large blocks
of white space. Certainly, in FITS files which have very large images
(> 10 Mb or more) this is not a particularly pressing
problem. However, for FITS files which have small amounts of data (or
are oriented primarily to metadata transport or capture) this is
simply wasteful.


The issues with metadata expression are serious for FITS with the
problems caused by the limitations on allowed FITS keyword names and
value data structures being the most significant. Certainly, as we
have already noted, in many cases it is possible to create one or more
conventions to expand the expression of the metadata but doing so will
result in files which are unparsable by downstream software which
don’t implement these conventions. There is no apparent solution,
using a FITS convention, than can solve the limitation on the
restricted expression of keyword names.


All of these metadata limitations are contrary to both the
“interchange” and “archivability” use cases for FITS. If the FITS
standard is followed with additional conventions we still need
specialized software and/or a human to successfully parse the content
of the metadata present. If the FITS standard is rigorously followed
sans conventions, then the author is severely limited in the metadata
they may express.


Keyword names and values must be allowed to be longer, and an expanded
character set would be useful as well. FITS metadata should be able to
express, as part of the FITS standard, many more data structures as
metadata. These include, but are not limited to things such as sets,
lists and objects.


\subsubsection{Awkwardness in representing the associations present in both data and metadata}


As data acquisition and data reduction systems have become more
complex there has been a move to storing multiple image data
components in extensions within a single FITS files. The FITS
extension mechanism provides a scheme for having multiple images but
in essentially a flat structure. If you have 12 images in the file
there is no way of indicating that 3 of them are data, 3 are an error
and 3 are a quality mask. Indeed, there is no way of specifying which
triplets are related. You can use the EXTNAME header to indicate
relationships but this relies on convention and string parsing rather
than being a standard part of the format.


The conversion of NDF format files (see Poster P91) to FITS and back
to NDF has demonstrated that you can represent a hierarchical data
grouping in the FITS multi-extension format, but this is done using
EXTNAME conventions combined with headers representing the extension
level in the hierarchy and the type of component and so is not
understood by other FITS tools. A standardised way of specifying
relationships between extensions would be extremely valuable to data
and application interoperability.


\subsubsection{No support for declaring byte order}


Although in the base FITS implementation (Wells et al. 1981) a
particular byte order was not designated, current versions of FITS
store data in big endian format only. Sometimes the byte order needs
to be checked and swapped to the native byte order in little endian
architectures when non-native data formats are not supported (as in
implementations of FITS readers which utilize C , Cython, and so
on). Programmers on little endian platforms who work with large data
volumes may find this limitation results in a significant performance
cost as marshalling data to and from the FITS big endian ordering will
be required. This is a frequent problem for astronomical
software. Little endianness is found on x86 and x86-64 processors that
are commonly used in Universities and research laboratories.


FITS should be able to declare the byte ordering of data by using a
FITS keyword defined in the standard dictionary.


\subsection{Inadequate support for large, distributed data}


Introduction to this section needed here…


\subsubsection{No support for capturing indeterminately sized data sets via streaming}


Frequently there is a need to store data from an instrument or remote
site that is being transmitted over a network. It is common that when
the transfer begins the final size of the data set is not known. Those
using FITS have handled this by writing such data to a file without
specifying the size of the last dimension in an image or table, and
when the stream is completed, the header is appropriately updated.


Nevertheless, there are applications for which one would like to
access all the other information before the file is complete. This may
be to integrate the data that is being read out, or to monitor
metadata. A library supporting the data format should support such
usage.


\subsubsection{No support for declaration of virtual and distributed components}


When FITS was created, the ‘file’ (bytes stored on durable physical
medium such as spinning disk or magnetic tape) was more or less the
only way to store and transfer data. The networked solutions which we
enjoy today were absent from the world of astronomy and storage of
astronomical data in databases was unusual. Code was run locally by
experts and the results, if shared at all, were usually only reported
in published papers. In the intervening years, computer and
information technologies have evolved and broadened; we now enjoy many
new means of accessing, providing and storing data. FITS should join
this revolution.


We should start to consider thinking of FITS as a ‘container’ of
astronomical information which is not necessarily a file. Is there
any reason to prevent our FITS ‘file’ from overlaying a portion of a
database? Why not allow FITS to be a wrapper about bytes held within a
distributed mass store such as IRODS or a cloud? Similarly, we would
want FITS to contain, and adequately access, data generated by a
service (think simulation data, for example). Possibly FITS could
itself execute simple stored algorithms to generate a portion of its
data\footnote{This probably implies the need for a “FITS language” to generate these data}.


These use cases are only examples of where we might go and some may be
arguably of limited value. Nevertheless, the generalized use case that
may be derived from all of these is of certain importance, namely,
FITS should be able to seamlessly specify data both contained locally
within itself and reference (and transparently access) data held in
non-local entities such as cloud storage, databases, and services and
other files.


The grouping convention includes a provision for specifying URI’s,
but the implementation is not adequate. There is no provision for
directing the machine on how to access the resource specified by the
URI.


\section{Summary - Significant problems exist in the FITS standard}


The problems which we have described are real and significant, however
we don’t wish to recommend a particular solution here to any of
these. Action to correct these issues should flow from constructive
community discussion and offered solutions to these problems. Possible
solutions may involve moving existing FITS conventions into the core
standard, modification of the FITS standard to remove limitations or
possibly transferring the FITS data model over into a new
serialisation, or some selection of these actions.


These technical problems will be solved one way or another. If the
community is not willing to do the hard work of hammering out a
universal (or widely-adopted) approach, individual projects will
continue to make their own ad-hoc solutions. Data formats will become
increasingly fragmented and we will no longer enjoy the easy
interoperability that FITS has provided for many years.
